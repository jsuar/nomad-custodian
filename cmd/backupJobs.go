	Long: `The backup-jobs command will created a new directory named with the current time
in seconds under the jobs-backup directory. All jobs register with Nomad will be written as 
a JSON file in the directory with the name of the job as the file name.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// backupJobsCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// backupJobsCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
